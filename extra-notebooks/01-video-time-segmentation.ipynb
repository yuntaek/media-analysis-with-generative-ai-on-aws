Usually, a shot represents a single camera position, but sometimes, shots may contain camera movements such as panning or zooming.

Therefore, one way to implement shot detection would be to used image embeddings such as Amazon Titan Multimodal embeddings to group similar frames to shots.   However, since we are operating on sampled frames, the accuracy of timestamps for the shots would be limited by our frame sampling rate.\n",

    "Even after identifying individual camera shots, there may still be semantically similar shots depicting the same setting. To further cluster these into distinct scenes, we expand frame comparison beyond adjacent frames. By looking at similar frames across an expanded time window, we can identify shots that are likely part of the same contiguous scene. We calculate pairwise similarity scores between all frames within a given time window. Frames with similarity scores above a certain threshold are considered part of the same scene group. This process performs recursively across all frames in a shot. \n",

The shot information for these highly similar frames is recorded. This process iterates for all frames in a shot to compile contextually similar shots.
